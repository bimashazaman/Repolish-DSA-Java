// what is Big O?
// Big O is a measure of the time complexity of an algorithm.

//Big O gives an upper bound of complexity in the worst case, helping the quantify performance as the input size increases.

// Big O is a measure of the worst case time complexity of an algorithm.

// how to calculate Big O?
// to calculate Big O, we need to know the time complexity of the algorithm.
// time complexity is the number of steps it takes to complete the algorithm.


// what is space complexity?
// space complexity is the number of memory locations needed to complete the algorithm.
